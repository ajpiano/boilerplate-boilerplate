# Boilerplate Boilerplate

Boilerplates are more than just really thick sheets of steel: they're the
totally most raddest way to get started developing. Thanks to projects
like [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Dojo
Boilerplate](https://github.com/rmurphey/dojo-boilerplate), [BoilerPlate Film
Budgeting Templates](http://www.boilerplate.net/Home.html), and [JavaScript
Library
Boilerplate](http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-library-boilerplate/), you
can pretty much do anything, starting on Step 2! Unfortunately, The tedium of Step 1
inevitably creeps back up on you if you want to write your own boilerplate for
others to use.  Until now.

## Introducing Boilerplate Boilerplate

Boilerplate Boilerplate is just a Git repository with a blank .gitignore and a
README.md.  This can save you up to 45 seconds per project!

2. Edit README.md and get rid of everything before the place where it says "GET RID OF EVERYTHING BEFORE HERE."
3. Substitute in your project's name

5. Give me credit
6. Preferably using the word "excellent"

# GET RID OF EVERYTHING BEFORE HERE (and this line, too)
